			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Matteo Morena, I’m a 23-year-old guy from northern Italy. I’m half German and half Italian and can speak both languages fluently. I like skiing, music, nature, hiking, and programming. This website is dedicated to share my interest in this last subject.</p>
			<p>Since I was a kid, I’ve always been passionate about computers, how they work, and how to program them. I still remember how I thought that using the terminal or the registry editor was like black magic. Of course, time has passed, and I learned a lot of things. The first thing I learned was to create batch scripts, then HTML and CSS, then Java, and so on.</p>
			<p>I enjoy programming both on the high and the low level. I started with Java, now I’m learning assembly programming, specifically for the IA32 and ARM architectures. I’m also starting to get my feet wet with bare metal programming.</p>
			<p>I know how to develop GUIs using languages like Java (Swing, JavaFX) and C#, but also how to write the back-end of websites making use of languages such as Python and C#. As a matter of fact, learning Django and Flask’s web frameworks was what made me try Python in the first place!</p>
			<p>Most of the time, I’m concerned with what happens behind the curtains. That is, layout and design are not really my strengths: my website does look quite spartan, doesn’t it?</p>
			<p>For the future I’m planning to learn how to build mobile applications and perhaps progressive web apps too. Currently, I’m taking a look at the native Android API and the Xamarin and React Native frameworks. My journey in the programming world has been—and still is—quite interesting, and there’s still so much to learn!</p>
